## Development

*aeon3odt* depends on the [pywriter](https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter) and the [aeon3yw](https://github.com/peter88213/aeon3yw) libraries which must be present in your file system. It is organized as an Eclipse PyDev project. The official release branch on GitHub is *main*.

### Conventions

- Minimum Python version is 3.6. 
- The Python **source code formatting** follows widely the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide, except the maximum line length, which is 120 characters here.
